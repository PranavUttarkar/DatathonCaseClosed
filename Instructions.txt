Case Closed!
** DISCLAIMER: SUBMISSIONS FOR THIS CHALLENGE WILL CLOSE AT 11:00AM ON SUNDAY** 
** THIS IS AN HOUR EARLIER THAN HACKING CLOSE**
The grid is your crime scene. Every move leaves evidence. Every turn could be your last. Welcome to Case Closed, a high-stakes AI programming challenge where you’ll train intelligent Python agents to outthink, outmaneuver, and outlast their opponents in a fast-paced grid arena. 
Every tick is a clue. Every direction, a decision. Move too fast, and you’ll collide with your own mistakes; move too slow, and your opponent will box you in. 
Inspired by the classic Tron Lightbike game, your agents must navigate a 2D grid where every move leaves behind a permanent barrier. One wrong turn — and its case closed.
Will your code be the perfect detective — reading patterns, predicting danger, and solving the puzzle before it’s too late?
Or will it become just another unsolved mystery in the grid?
Objective:
Your mission is to design and train an autonomous agent that can survive longer than its opponent in a series of head-to-head matches. 
Each tick, both agents simultaneously choose a direction (up, down, left, or right). Every cell they move through becomes a wall that cannot be crossed again—by either player. The round ends when one or both agents collide with a wall or each other.
Gameplay Details:
The arena is a 18 x 20 grid 


Each agent’s move leaves a trail that acts as a barrier.


Agents receive state information each tick (positions, remaining open spaces, opponent’s direction).


Colliding with any trail means instant elimination.


If both agents crash simultaneously, it’s a draw.





Each tick, your agent receives a JSON payload with key details like:
Current position (your coordinates and your opponent’s)


Board layout (walls, trails, open spaces)


Available boosts and remaining turns


Opponent’s last direction

Key Restrictions:
‼️ Note: A 5GB image size restriction is placed on each team’s Docker image.

‼️ For this competition, we are limiting participants to using CPU-only Pytorch. GPU builds, such as CUDA, are too large and slow to build for our platform to run in time. The base image your agent will be built off of will include this version.

‼️ Use of Tensorflow, JAX, or any other large ML libraries may be disallowed.

We highly recommend you try to Dockerize your agent using the provided Dockerfile prior to submitting. This ensures our pipeline can build your submission as well.

If your Docker image does not build, your agent may not be able to participate in the tournament.
Get Started + Challenge Goals:
Use this repository as a template to start making your agent. READ THE README.


Develop a Python-based AI agent capable of strategic movement and survival.


Experiment with reinforcement learning, search algorithms, or heuristic logic to maximize win rates.


Optimize your agent for adaptability, prediction, and efficient pathfinding in confined environments.

Helpful Tips:


Keep your agent.py logic modular — separate decision logic, state parsing, and move evaluation into helper functions.


Test performance locally — timeouts or heavy computations can cause missed moves.


If using ML or search algorithms, cache repeated evaluations to save computation time.


Don’t forget to list every dependency in requirements.txt — missing one will break your submission.


Always test your container before submitting.

Submission Guidelines:
You must submit a Github repo to Devpost before submissions close.
